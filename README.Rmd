# sunburst R package

The goal of sunburst is to simplify generation of sunburst plots in R. 
These plots are particularly useful for visualising the relative frequency of elements in a heirarchical ontology.

For example, microbial composition of a microbiome sample, or composition of cancer types in a large cohort.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sunburst like so:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("selkamand/sunburst")
```

## Usage

For general usage see [general usage](./articles/general_usage.html)

To visualise microbial composition see [microbial sunbursts vignette](./articles/microbial_sunbursts.html)

## Example Plots
